## Solution Description

A responsive landing page built with HTML and vanilla CSS.

### Learnings

- I used CSS for form validation, guided by [Kevin Powell's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awNYtIAu6pI), _"Very small CSS tweaks for better forms,"_.

### Challenges

- Adding background images to the hero section and making them responsive across different screen sizes was a challenge. I believe the design turned out well, but I will continue exploring ways to use background images more efficiently.
